stage_harbor_artifacts
======================

Runs on the connected side. Downloads the Harbor offline installer, records its
sha256 in a manifest shaped as a `group_vars` file, and can push the kit to the
repository each air-gapped environment pulls from (Nexus raw hosted or
Artifactory generic).

The manifest, `harbor_artifacts.yml`, is what lets each environment verify the
installer after transfer. Drop it into `inventory/group_vars/registry/`.

Requirements
------------

Internet access on the host running it. `dnf download` for the optional Docker RPMs.
